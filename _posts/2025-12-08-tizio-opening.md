On December 1, 2025, the new "Transfer- und Innovationszentrum im Oberland" (TIZIO) opened its doors in Bad Tölz. Our research group is part of this research center, operating in one of the four high-tech labs, the IoT-Prototyping Lab. This means we will work alongside our neighboring labs, which focus on additive manufacturing, automation and robotics, and tourism, sustainability and quality of life. The opening ceremony was attended by various political representatives. Among them were:
- Dr. Markus Söder, Minister-President of Bavaria
- Markus Blume, State Minister for Science and Arts
- Prof. Dr. Martin Leitner, President of Munich University of Applied Sciences
- Prof. Dr. Thomas Stumpp, Vice President of Munich University of Applied Sciences
- Dr. Ingo Mehner, Mayor of Bad Tölz

Throughout the opening day, we hosted several laboratory tours that allowed for a exchange with representatives from both local businesses and globally operating companies. In these interactions we introduced them to modern IoT topics like WebAssembly and how it can be used in embedded systems. We also had conversations about how open-source tools can simplify the entry into Chip Design. The day’s conversations made it clear that there is a high level of interest in both IoT and hardware development, signaling strong potential for future project collaborations and innovative partnerships within the region.

We are looking forward to future exchanges and exciting projects with local partners!
