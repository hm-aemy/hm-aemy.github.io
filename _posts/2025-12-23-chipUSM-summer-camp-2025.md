The ChipUSM Summer Camp 2025 – Digital Track represents one of the educational outcomes of the ongoing efforts of the AEMY research group to promote open-source integrated circuit design education at universities in Germany and worldwide. The course builds directly on the same open-source System-on-Chip (SoC) that was used in the group’s first silicon tape-out, completed in September, thereby establishing a strong link between research, real silicon, and education.

The summer camp was held over five intensive days, from December 9 to December 13, in Valparaíso, Chile, and was organized by the ChipUSM student initiative at the Technical University Federico Santa María (UTFSM). It brought together undergraduate and graduate students interested in gaining hands-on experience with modern digital IC design methodologies using professional-grade open-source tools.

The course was conceived as an immersive, in-person program following a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach. Short theoretical introductions were combined with extensive guided practical sessions, where students were presented with concrete design challenges and encouraged to explore, experiment, and iterate on solutions. Through this methodology, participants worked collaboratively on a realistic SoC design, engaging directly with the structure and complexity of contemporary digital systems while experiencing a complete open-source RTL-to-GDS design flow.

From an AEMY perspective, this activity illustrates how research-driven open-source design efforts can be effectively transferred into educational settings, fostering reproducible workflows, lowering entry barriers, and enabling students to work with the same design artifacts and methodologies used in cutting-edge academic and industrial projects.

# Course overview and objectives

The Digital Track was designed as a guided exploration of the complete RTL-to-GDS design flow, using the [CROC SoC](https://github.com/pulp-platform/croc), an open-source RISC-V–based system developed within the [PULP Platform](https://pulp-platform.org/). By working with an existing, production-quality design, students were able to focus on understanding each stage of the flow rather than spending time building infrastructure from scratch.

## General objective

To introduce participants to the complete open-source digital design flow using a real and industry-relevant SoC, emphasizing conceptual understanding, practical tool usage, and design reproducibility.

## Course structure and content

The camp followed a Project-Based Learning (PBL) methodology. Each module combined short theoretical introductions with extensive guided practical sessions:

1. Module 1: Introduction and Tools Installation
2. Module 2: RTL Structure and Simulation
3. Module 3: Logic Synthesis and Timing Analysis
4. Module 4: Physical Design Flow
5. Module 5: Digital Design Flow with Librelane
