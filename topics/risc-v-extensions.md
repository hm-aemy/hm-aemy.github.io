title: RISC-V Extensions
---

[RISC-V](https://riscv.org) is an open instruction set architecture, which is
the interface between software and a processor. As an open standard it
accelerates new innovative chip platforms, industry competition and easier
access from academia.

The AEMY team is one of the key European entities of RISC-V and is involved in
the RISC-V leadership and broad community. In research we focus on the
extendability of RISC-V in the following areas:

- RISC-V compressed instructions for signal processing
- RISC-V support to accelerate the execution of bytecode virtual machines
- Framework for the exploration of RISC-V high-density compressed instructions
  using variable length instruction coding for application domains
