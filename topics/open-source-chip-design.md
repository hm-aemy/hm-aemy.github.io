title: Open Source Chip Design
---

Open Source tools for chip design have seen an incredible boost over the last
years, mainly due to the influx of curious software developers in chip design
and the increased attention around sovereignty of chip design. The ease of
access for academia, hobbyists and also industry is a key cornerstone of
attracting more talent and driving innovative chip design in mature technology
nodes.

Our main focus areas include:

- Collaboration in the open source simulator tool
  [Verilator](https://verilator.org), including instrumentation support for
  fault injection techniques.
- Tool interoperability of major open source tools like
  [CIRCT](https://circt.llvm.org), [Yosys](https://yosys.org) and
  [Verilator](https://verilator.org)
- Improved support for modern verification methodologies
