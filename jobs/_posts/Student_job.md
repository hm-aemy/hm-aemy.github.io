Dear Students,

We are currently looking for motivated students to join our research team. If you are interested in working on cutting-edge topics and want to gain hands-on experience, this is an exciting opportunity. 

You can get involved in the following areas:

Topic: An Open-Source SoC-Capable Network in chip ( NoC) Generator    

We are developing advanced NoC architectures, with a focus on **Constellation**, a state-of-the-art open-source Chisel-based NoC generator that enables highly customizable and scalable interconnects for heterogeneous SoC designs. You will have the opportunity to explore various NoC configurations, optimize performance, and integrate novel protocols into SoC designs.                

This research could be a great fit if you are interested in:
Designing and verifying on-chip interconnect systems
Exploring NoC topologies and protocols for multi-core architectures
SoC integration using open-source frameworks like Chipyard and Rocketchip

Whether you're at the stage of writing your **Bachelor’s or Master’s thesis**, we encourage you to apply and become part of our team. This is a fantastic opportunity to work on real-world challenges and build a strong foundation in VLSI and SoC design.  
 
If this sounds exciting, please feel free to reach out with your CV and a brief statement of interest.
