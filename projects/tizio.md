We are part of the newly founded [TIZIO (Transfer- und Innovationszentrum im Oberland)](https://hm.edu/kooperationen_transfer/tizio/index.de.html) based in Bad Tölz. There we have the [lab for IoT-Prototyping](https://hm.edu/kooperationen_transfer/tizio/labor_iot.de.html).

In this lab, we work on solutions related to:

- Digitization of production
- IT security & zero-trust environment
- Embedded systems 

We also investigate concepts such as WebAssembly for Embedded Systems. Here, an efficient in-line interpreter for WASM programms is developed that can execute the bytecode without having to convert it into an intermediate representation.
