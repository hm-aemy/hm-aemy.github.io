Our team leads the research project *Open Source Verification of Instruction Set
Extensions (OSVISE)* which is funded by the German Ministry of Research and
Education in their [open source EDA software program](https://www.elektronikforschung.de/foerderung/bekanntmachungen/design).

Three work areas are covered by OSVISE:

- Efficient evaluation and verification of instruction set extensions
- Evaluation of non-functional properties of such extenions
- Improving support of linear temporal logic across multiple open source EDA
  tools

All results of the project will be open source. The following diagram shows the
contributions of the project and how they integrate with existing open source
tools.

HM-AEMY contributions to the project are centered around the [CIRCT LLVM
framework](https://circt.llvm.org).
