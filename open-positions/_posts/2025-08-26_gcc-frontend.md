Program analysis is the study of computer programs to assess their correctness, robustness, safety, and performance. R3 is a static analysis tool originally developed for programs written in the C language, with planned extensions to support C++ in the future. At present, a C++ front end based on Clang (QuickDump) has been developed.
To broaden compatibility and integrate with the GCC compiler, we are seeking a motivated student to design and implement a new C++ front end. This work will not only extend R3’s capabilities but also contribute to research in compiler technology and program analysis.
Potential areas of focus include:
-	Analyzing how R3 currently handles C++ code
-	Designing and implementing a parser for translating programs into the GAST graph
-	Developing a new C++ front end compatible with GCC’s back end (QuickGcc)
-	Creating test programs in C++ to validate the new front end
-	Evaluating the performance and accuracy of QuickGcc

This project offers an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in compilers, static analysis, and advanced C++ language features.
